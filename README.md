# DogMash

This application was a personal project for me to learn Flask. Inspired from the movie 'Social Network' where Mark Zuckerberg created facemash, dogmash is the same thing except without the controversial nature. 

It was a great introduction to web development, which is something I hope to experiment with more. 

There are few improvements I hope to make, but will take some time. The matchmaking currently is random, but I hope to implement skill based matchmaking, which means that the image will only go up against one with a similar elo. Secondly, as the current match making is random, some images will never go against each other. So I first hope to implement a function which exhausts all possible combinations of pairings. This shouldn't take too long and I hope to implement this soon. 

If you have any suggestions that sound cool, let me know.
